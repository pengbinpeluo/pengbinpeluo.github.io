I am a Research Assistant Professor at [Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES)](https://nres.illinois.edu) and Senior Research Scientist at [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (ISEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). I was broadly trained in both science (geography, agriculture, hydrology, ecology, crop physiology, global climate change) and engineering (computer engineering and high-performance computing, civil & environmental engineering, and geoinformatics engineering). My primary research interests are computational and process-based modeling (hydrological, crop, ecosystem and earth system modeling), remote sensing, model-data integration, geospatial big data and artificial intelligence for sustainable human-environment interaction. The overarching goal of my research is to deepen our understanding of terrestrial carbon-water-nutrient cycles and human impacts on managed agroecosystems under climate change and land use intensification, to develop innovative engineering technologies and finally find systems solutions for sustainable ecosystem management. The societal drivers for these research interests include climate change adaptation and mitigation, managing the risk of hydrometeorological and hydroclimatological disasters like droughts and floods, ensuring water, energy and food securities and environmental sustainability, as well as fostering rural economy and farmer wellbeing. Over the past years, I have been focusing on the U.S. Midwestern agroecosystems.
