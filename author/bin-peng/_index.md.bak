I am an incoming Tenure-track Assistant Professor on Water (quality and quantity) and Agriculture at [Department of Crop Sciences](https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). Before that, I am a Research Assistant Professor at [Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES)](https://nres.illinois.edu) and Senior Research Scientist at [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (ISEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). I was broadly trained in both science (hydrology, agriculture, geography, ecology, crop physiology, and global climate change) and engineering (civil & environmental engineering, geoinformatics engineering, and high-performance computing). My primary research interests are to understand the complex water, nutrient, and carbon cycles over the broad agricultural landscape. I use field measurement, computational and process-based modeling (hydrological, cropping system, ecosystem and earth system modeling), remote sensing, model-data integration, geospatial big data and artificial intelligence in my research. I am motivated to push the boundary of science and develop innovative technologies and systems solutions in digital agriculture, precision conservation, sustainable agri-food systems and human-environment interactions under land use intensification and climate change. The societal drivers for these research interests include ensuring water, energy and food securities and environmental sustainability, as well as fostering rural economy and farmer wellbeing in the United States and around the world.
