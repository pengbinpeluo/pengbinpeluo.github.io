I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Water and Agriculture at [Department of Crop Sciences](https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu). My core research interests center around unraveling the complexities of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles within diverse agricultural landscapes and their interconnectedness with downstream water quality. To tackle these challenges, my research leverages various tools and methods, including field measurement, computational and process-based modeling (hydrological, cropping system, ecosystem and earth system modeling), remote sensing, geospatial big data, model-data integration, and artificial intelligence. I am deeply motivated to drive transdisciplinary, convergence, and use-inspired research for breaking new ground in scientific exploration. Moreover, I am passionate about developing innovative technologies and systems solutions in digital agriculture and precision conservation to foster sustainable agri-food systems and preserve healthy watersheds amidst the pressures of land use intensification and climate change. The driving force behind my research pursuits lies in addressing critical societal issues, including ensuring water, food and energy security, enhancing water quality and environmental sustainability, and nurturing rural economies and human well-being both in the United States and across the globe.
