The <strong>Water, Agriculture, and Conservation Innovation Lab (WACI Lab) </strong> led by Dr. Bin Peng at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is recruiting multiple postdoctoral researchers and graduate students on watershed hydrology and water quality starting in spring, summer, or fall of 2024. We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic members who are interested in unraveling the complexities of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles within diverse agricultural landscapes and their interconnectedness with downstream water quality. Please refer to the {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< staticref "uploads/Peng_recruiting_202309_final.pdf" "newtab" >}}recruiting flyer {{< /staticref >}} for more details.

* <strong>Area 1: Watershed hydrology and water quality modeling.</strong> This position is to advance our understanding of the complex two-way scaling from field-scale management interventions to watershed-scale water quality through systems-level computational and process-based modeling. Candidates with strong background in agroecosystem modeling, biogeochemical modeling, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological modeling, watershed hydrological modeling, reactive transport modeling, river hydraulic modeling are particularly encouraged to apply.

* <strong>Area 2: Environmental data science for agricultural hydrology and water quality.</strong> This position is to improve our prediction capability of watershed hydrology and water quality with environmental data science techniques by linking environmental drivers and management factors with hydrological and water quality variables. Candidates with strong skills in machine learning, deep learning, geospatial analytics and remote sensing are particularly encouraged to apply. Experiences in handling large-scale datasets are highly preferred.

* <strong>Area 3: Water quality monitoring, sensing, and data analytics.</strong> This position is to discover knowledge with high-frequency water quality monitoring data. Candidates with strong interests and experiences in using high-frequency sensor data to reveal most fundamental knowledge about mechanisms and controls of nutrient export patterns and pathways from field to watershed scales are encouraged to apply for this position. Experiences in water quality sensor development, calibration, deployment, maintenance, and data analytics are highly preferred. 

* <strong>Area 4: Agricultural water footprint. </strong> This position is to improve the quantification of green, blue and gray water footprints of agricultural production with improved process-based modeling and remote sensing capacities at regional to global scales. Candidates with strong interests and skills in improving crop growth models and soil biogeochemistry models in earth system models and using large-scale remote sensing products to estimate agricultural water use are encouraged to apply.
