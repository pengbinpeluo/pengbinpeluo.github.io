The Agroecosystem Sustainability Center (ASC) at [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (ISEE)](https://sustainability.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu) has multiple opening positions for postdoctoral researchers and Ph.D. students working on modeling and remote sensing over the agroecosystems. 

* <strong>Area 1: Agroecosystem modeling.</strong> Expertise/interest in soil biogeochemistry, ecosystem modeling, and advanced data-model integration. We will recruit both postdoctoral researcher / Ph.D. student. Targeted ecosystem models in our group include: (1) ecosys, an advanced ecosystem model with full representation of soil C-N-P cycles; and (2) CLM, the land component of U.S. flagship earth system model CESM.

* <strong>Area 2: Water Quality and Hydrological Modeling.</strong> Expertise/interest in watershed hydrology, hydrodynamics, groundwater, flow in porous medium and mathematics. We will recruit both postdoctoral researcher / Ph.D. student.

* <strong>Area 3: IoT and Vehicle Sensing of Agroecosystem.</strong> Expertise/interest in remote sensing, electronics, field work, and computer vision. We will recruit both postdoctoral researcher / Ph.D. student.

Candidates with strong backgrounds in programming, process-based modeling and remote sensing would be highly preferred. Please send a cover letter, CV, and contact information of three references via email to Dr. Xiang Zhu (xzh@illinois.edu). 

UIUC ranks top worldwide in Agricultural Science, Computer Science & Engineering, and Environmental Science. The University of Illinois administration, faculty, and staff embrace diversity and are committed to attracting qualified candidates who also embrace and value diversity and inclusivity. International students have the flexibility to study remotely considering the COVID-19 situation.
