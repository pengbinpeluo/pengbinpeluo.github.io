The <strong>Water, Agriculture, and Conservation Innovation Lab (WACI Lab) </strong> led by Dr. Bin Peng at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is recruiting multiple postdoctoral researchers and graduate students on watershed hydrology and water quality. We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic members who are interested in unraveling the complexities of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles within diverse agricultural landscapes and their interconnectedness with downstream water quality. Please refer to the {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< staticref "uploads/Peng_recruiting_202402_final.pdf" "newtab" >}}recruiting flyer {{< /staticref >}} for more details.

* <strong>Area 1: Watershed hydrology and water quality modeling.</strong> This position is to build next-generation hydrological and water quality models and use the systems modeling to advance our understanding of the complex two-way scaling from field-scale farming management to watershed-scale water quality. Candidates with strong background in agroecosystem modeling, biogeochemical modeling, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological modeling, watershed hydrological modeling, reactive transport modeling, river hydraulic modeling are particularly encouraged to apply.

* <strong>Area 2: Environmental data science for hydrology and water quality.</strong> This position is to develop high-resolution environmental (such as field-scale soil moisture and inundation) and management (such as conservation practices) data layers with advanced remote sensing and geospatial big data analytics and to further build data-driven models linking environmental and management drivers with watershed-scale hydrological and water quality variables. Candidates with strong skills in quantitative remote sensing (optical, thermal, and microwave), machine learning, deep learning, geospatial analytics are particularly encouraged to apply. Experiences in handling large-scale datasets are highly preferred.

* <strong>Area 3: Hydrological and water quality monitoring, sensing, and data analytics.</strong> This position is to discover knowledge with high-frequency hydrological and water quality monitoring data from IoT sensor networks and to reveal spatial patterns of water quality variables through integrated sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. Candidates with strong interests and experiences in using high-frequency sensor data to investigate mechanisms and controls of nutrient export patterns and pathways from field to watershed scales or with experiences with water quality remote sensing are encouraged to apply for this position. Experiences in water quality sensor development, calibration, deployment, maintenance, data analytics and/or remote sensing are highly preferred.

* <strong>Area 4: Agricultural water footprint. </strong> This position is to improve the quantification of green, blue and gray water footprints of agricultural production with improved process-based modeling and remote sensing capacities at regional to global scales. Candidates with strong interests and skills in improving crop growth models and soil biogeochemistry models in earth system models and using large-scale remote sensing products to estimate agricultural water use are encouraged to apply.
