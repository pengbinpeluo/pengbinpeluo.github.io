The Water, Agriculture and Conservation Innovation Lab (WACI Lab) led by Dr. Bin Peng at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is recruiting multiple postdoctoral researchers and graduate students on watershed hydrology and water quality starting in spring, summer, or fall of 2024. We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic members who are interested in unraveling the complexities of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles within diverse agricultural landscapes and their interconnectedness with downstream water quality. Please [click here](./Peng_recruiting_202309_final.pdf) for more details. Please refer to the {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< staticref "uploads/Peng_recruiting_202309_final.pdf" "newtab" >}}recruiting flyer {{< /staticref >}} for more details.

* <strong>Area 1: Watershed hydrology and water quality modeling.</strong> This position is to advance our understanding of the complex two-way scaling from field-scale management interventions to watershed-scale water quality through systems-level computational and process-based modeling. Candidates with strong background in agroecosystem modeling, biogeochemical modeling, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological modeling, watershed hydrological modeling, reactive transport modeling, river hydraulic modeling are particularly encouraged to apply.

* <strong>Area 2: Environmental data science.</strong> This position is to improve our prediction capability of watershed hydrology and water quality with environmental data science techniques by linking environmental drivers and management factors with hydrological and water quality variables. Candidates with strong skills in machine learning, deep learning, geospatial analytics and remote sensing are particularly encouraged to apply. Experiences in handling large-scale datasets are highly preferred.
