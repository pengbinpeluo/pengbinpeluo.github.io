The <strong>Water, Agriculture, and Conservation Innovation Lab (WACI Lab) </strong> led by Dr. Bin Peng at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is recruiting multiple postdoctoral researchers and graduate students on the water-agriculture nexus from microscale to macroscale for 2025. We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic members who are interested in (1) improving plant traits and soil health by harnessing plant-soil-microbe interactions, and (2) unraveling the complexities of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles within diverse agricultural landscapes and their interconnectedness with downstream water quality and the broad environmental system. Please refer to the {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< staticref "uploads/Peng_recruiting_202410_final.pdf" "newtab" >}}recruiting flyer {{< /staticref >}} for more details.

* <strong>Area 1: Plant-soil-microbe interaction modeling. </strong> This position is to build multi-scale plant-soil-microbe interaction models and further integrate these models with multi-omics and meta-omics data to investigate the synergies and tradeoffs of multiple plant or/and microbial traits and their impacts on crop water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The work is expected to be fully integrated with advanced breeding and bioengineering programs. Candidates with strong research interests, background, and potential in computational systems biology, quantitative genetics, crop growth modeling, plant functional-structural modeling, root growth and rhizosphere modeling, soil hydrology and reactive transport modeling, microbial ecology and biogeochemistry modeling, earth system modeling are encouraged to apply.

* <strong>Area 2: Watershed hydrology and water quality modeling.</strong> This position is to build next-generation watershed hydrological and water quality models and use the systems modeling to advance our understanding of the complex two-way scaling from field-scale farming management to watershed-scale water quality. Candidates with strong research interests, background, and potential in agroecosystem modeling, biogeochemical modeling, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological modeling, watershed hydrological modeling, reactive transport modeling, river hydraulic modeling are particularly encouraged to apply.

* <strong>Area 3: Watershed hydrology and water quality monitoring and sensing.</strong> This position is to discover knowledge with high-frequency hydrological and water quality monitoring data from IoT sensor networks and to reveal spatial patterns of water quality variables through integrated sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. Candidates with strong research interests, background, and potential in using high-frequency sensor data to investigate mechanisms and controls of nutrient export patterns and pathways from field to watershed scales or in water quality remote sensing (UAV and Satellite) are encouraged to apply for this position. Experiences in water quality sensor development, calibration, deployment, maintenance, data analytics and/or remote sensing are highly preferred. 

* <strong>Area 4: Environmental data science for watershed hydrology and water quality.</strong> This position is to develop high-resolution environmental (such as field-scale soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and inundation dynamics) and management (such as conservation practices) data layers with advanced remote sensing and geospatial big data analytics and to further build data-driven or hybrid models linking environmental and management drivers with watershed-scale hydrological and water quality variables. Candidates with strong research interests, background, and potential in quantitative remote sensing (optical, thermal, and microwave), machine learning, deep learning, geospatial analytics are particularly encouraged to apply. Experiences in handling large-scale datasets are highly preferred.

* <strong>Area 5: Modeling agriculture in the Earth system.</strong> This position is to improve the representation of agriculture and human management in the Earth System Models for assessing different climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies related to agriculture and quantifying water (blue, green, and gray) and carbon footprints of agricultural production at regional to global scales. Candidates with strong research interests, background and potential in earth system modeling, large-scale hydrological modeling, ecosystem modeling, crop growth modeling, and geospatial data science are encouraged to apply.
